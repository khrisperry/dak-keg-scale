## ⚖️ First-Time Scale Calibration

Your Keg Scale is usually calibrated before shipping, but it may require recalibration after installation.

To calibrate the scale:

1. **Place the scale where it will be permanently installed.**
2. Go to the Keg Scale's web interface.
3. Under the **Calibrate** section, click **Set Zero Calibration**.
