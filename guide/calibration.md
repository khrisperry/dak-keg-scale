## ⚖️ First-Time Scale Calibration

Your Keg Scale is factory-calibrated, but after installation — or any time you relocate the scale—you should run a fresh calibration.

---

### 🏠 Step 1: Place the Scale in Its Permanent Location

Set the scale exactly where it will live long-term (countertop, kegerator floor, etc.).  
A level, vibration-free surface gives the most accurate readings.

---

### 🌐 Step 2: Open the Scale’s Web Interface

1. Connect to the scale’s IP address (or hostname).  
2. Navigate to the **Calibrate** section.

---

### 🔄 Step 3: Zero the Scale

Click **Set Zero Calibration** with **nothing** on the platform.

### 🏋️ Step 4: Set Calibration Point 1

1. Place a known weight on the scale (e.g., **7.2 lb**).  
2. Enter **7.2** in **Cal Point 1 Weight (lb)**.

3. Wait ~5 seconds for the reading to stabilize, then click **Set Cal Point 1**.

### 🏋️‍♂️ Step 5: Set Calibration Point 2

1. Replace the first weight with a **heavier** known weight (e.g., **15.2 lb**).  
2. Enter **15.2** in **Cal Point 2 Weight (lb)**.

3. After ~5 seconds, click **Set Cal Point 2**.

### ✅ Step 6: Verify the Result

The **Calibrated Weight** field should now display the correct weight of the item on the platform.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to Check |
|-------|---------------|
| **Weight is off after calibration** | Make sure the scale was empty when setting Zero; confirm the entered weights match the physical weights; verify you waited for stabilization before saving each point. |
| **“Set Cal Point” buttons are greyed out** | Confirm you entered a numeric value in the corresponding weight field. |
| **Readings drift over time** | Ensure the scale is on a stable, level surface and not exposed to temperature swings or vibration. Re-run the calibration if needed. |
| **Buttons unresponsive** | Refresh the page, or power-cycle the scale and reconnect. |
