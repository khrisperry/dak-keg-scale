## 📶 Getting Started: Connecting Your Keg-a-Weigher Scale to Wi-Fi

Your scale ships with a built-in captive portal to make Wi-Fi setup easy.

---

### 🔌 Step 1: Power On the Scale

Plug the scale into a USB power source using the included cable.  
The device will boot up automatically.

---

### 📡 Step 2: Connect to the Setup Wi-Fi Network

On your phone, tablet, or computer:

1. Open your **Wi-Fi settings**
2. Connect to the network:  
   **`KegScaleWiFi`**
3. Enter the password:  
   **`MMMMBeer`**  _(four M’s, capital B)_

> ⚠️ This is a **temporary** network for setup only.

---

### 🌐 Step 3: Open the Captive Portal

After connecting:

- Most devices will automatically open the setup page
- If not, manually open a browser and go to:  
  **http://192.168.4.1**

You will see the **Keg-a-Weigher Wi-Fi Setup Page**

---

### 📲 Step 4: Enter Your Wi-Fi Credentials

1. Select your home/business Wi-Fi network
2. Enter your **Wi-Fi password**
3. Click **Save & Reboot**

The scale will reboot and attempt to connect to your Wi-Fi.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Verify Connection

- If successful, the **KegScaleWiFi** network will disappear and the device will join your Wi-Fi.
- If it fails, the device will return to **KegScaleWiFi** mode so you can try again.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ❌ I don’t see the `KegScaleWiFi` network

- Ensure the scale is powered on
- Move closer to the scale
- Reboot the device (unplug/plug in)

---

### ❌ The setup page didn’t open

- Open a browser and go to: **http://192.168.4.1**
- If that doesn’t work, forget the network and reconnect, or try a different device

---

### ❌ I entered the wrong Wi-Fi password

- The device will fail to connect and return to **KegScaleWiFi**
- Reconnect to the setup network and try again at **http://192.168.4.1**

---

### ❌ The scale keeps returning to setup mode

- Double-check the Wi-Fi password (case-sensitive)
- Make sure your router supports **2.4GHz** (not 5GHz only)
- Ensure the signal is strong near the scale
- Avoid using enterprise or login-protected Wi-Fi networks

## 🛠️ Initial Wi-Fi Setup

When your Keg Scale is first powered on, it creates a temporary Wi-Fi hotspot so you can connect it to your home network.

2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network named:
   ```
   KegScaleWiFi
   ```
3. Enter the password:
   ```
   MMMMBeer
   ```

---

### 🌐 Step 2: Open the Configuration Page
Once connected, your device may automatically open a setup page.  
If not, open your browser and enter:
```
http://192.168.4.1/
```

---

### 🧭 Step 3: Select and Connect to Your Wi-Fi

You’ll see a list of available networks. It may look like this:

### 🔄 Step 4: Reconnect to Your Regular Wi-Fi

Once the Keg Scale attempts to join your selected Wi-Fi:

- The Keg Scale is no longer broadcasting its own Wi-Fi network.

---

### 🔍 Step 5: Find the Keg Scale on Your Network (Optional)

If needed, locate your device’s IP address using your router's connected devices list.
